In this package, we provide two useful tools for determine a reasonable training set for genomic selection or prediction. In order to have a better prediction to the genomic This package provides two useful tools for determining a proper training set for genomic selection or prediction. In order to have a better prediction of the genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV), the training set should be optimized as highly genomic correlated with the test set as possible. Several criteria have been published previously, including:

- Prediction error variance (PEV; [Akdemir et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12711-015-0116-6))
- Generalized coefficient of determination (CD; [LaloÃ« et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9686-28-4-359))

Our research provides an alternative criterion, **r-score**, which is derived from Pearson's correlation between GEBVs and phenotypic values of a test set. We could determine both a reasonable training set size and an optimal training set for building a prediction model with the criteria. Both functions are provided in our package.

For more information on the method, please check our published article:

## Installation

The development version of TSDFGS can be installed from GitHub (recommend):

``` r
# library(devtools)
install_github("oumarkme/TSDFGS", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

You may also install the stable version from CRAN, which the most recent function may not include.

``` r
install.packages("TSDFGS")
```

- All functions were developed under r version 4.2.0 and tested in both version 3.6.3 and 4.1.1. However, we recommend you to use this package with R version > 3.6.3.
- Rcpp and RcppEigen were used in the package. In addition, the core C++ scripts were published on GitHub for those who want a better performance.


## Main functions

- `r_score`: Function for calculating r-score ([more](https://www.oumark.me/TSDFGS/reference/r_score.html)).
- `pev_score`: Function for calculating PEV score ([more](https://www.oumark.me/TSDFGS/reference/pev_score.html)).
- `cd_score`: Function for Calculating CD score ([more](https://www.oumark.me/TSDFGS/reference/cd_score.html)).
- `optTrain`: Function for determining optimal training set ([more](https://www.oumark.me/TSDFGS/reference/optTrain.html)).
- `SSDFGS`: Function for determining reasonable training set size ([more](https://www.oumark.me/TSDFGS/reference/SSDFGS.html)).

## Example dataset
An example data provided for testing this package. The rice genome data was published by [Zhao et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms1467) in their research. Raw dataset is available at the [Rice Diversity website](http://www.ricediversity.org/data/). Pre-arranged dataset is available in this GitHub repository and you may loaded in R by

``` r
load(url("https://github.com/oumarkme/TSDFGS/raw/main/data/rice.RData"))
```
