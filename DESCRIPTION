Description: We propose an optimality criterion to determine the required training set, r-score, which is derived directly from Pearson's correlation between the genomic estimated breeding values and phenotypic values of the test set <doi:10.1007/s00122-019-03387-0>. This package provides two main functions to determine a good training set and size.
